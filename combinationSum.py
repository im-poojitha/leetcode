"""
----- Pick & Not Pick Approach -----

combinationSum(candidates, target):
* This is the main function.

- res to store the final result (list of valid combinations).

- curr to store the current combination being built.

- index and Sum to track position and current sum.

It calls the dfs function to start the backtracking search.

dfs(index, curr, Sum, candidates, target, res):
* This is the recursive function (depth-first search with backtracking).

Base cases:

1. If Sum == target: We found a valid combination â†’ add a copy of curr to res.

2. If Sum > target or we've gone past the end (index == len(candidates)): stop exploring this path.

Recursive steps:

- Include the current number (candidates[index]) and call dfs again without moving the index (since we can reuse the same number).

- Backtrack by removing the last number added (curr.pop()).

- Exclude the current number and move to the next index (index + 1).
